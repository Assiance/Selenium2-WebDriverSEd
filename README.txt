Make sure to let me know if you are having any issues with anything and I will get to fixing them as soon as I can

or if you are up to it you are welcome to give fixing it a try. Just send the files and I will get them in the repo as

soon as possible and also make sure to give you some credit. This repo is sure to stay active. My company is planning

on writing their tests for most of their software in selenium and I'm in the process of converting 2000+ tests.

So I'm busy trying to make re-writing those tests as easy as possible.
